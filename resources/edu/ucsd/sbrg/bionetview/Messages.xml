  This configuration describes the labels of buttons and menu items or 
  some important user messages in SBMLsqueezer-related graphical user interfaces.
  Although the preferred way would be to have separate key-value pairs for
  actual labels and their corresponding tooltips, you may want to use just 
  one key-value pair, in which the tooltip is located after the separator 
  ";". Otherwise, please use the suffix "_TOOLTIP" to indicate a tooltip 
  for some label.
  
  Please see the JavaDoc for MessageFormatter and Formatter.
