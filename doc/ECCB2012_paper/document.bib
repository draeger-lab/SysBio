	metabolic and signaling pathways, molecular and genetic interactions
	and gene regulation networks. Using BioPAX, millions of interactions,
	organized into thousands of pathways, from many organisms are available

  abstract = {SUMMARY: The specifications of the Systems Biology Markup Language
	(SBML) define standards for storing and exchanging computer models
	of biological processes in text files. In order to perform model
	simulations, graphical visualizations and other software manipulations,
	an in-memory representation of SBML is required. We developed JSBML
	for this purpose. In contrast to prior implementations of SBML APIs,
	JSBML has been designed from the ground up for the Java programming
	language, and can therefore be used on all platforms supported by
	a Java Runtime Environment. This offers important benefits for Java
	users, including the ability to distribute software as Java Web Start
	applications. JSBML supports all SBML Levels and Versions through
	Level 3 Version 1, and we have strived to maintain the highest possible
	degree of compatibility with the popular library libSBML. JSBML also
	supports modules that can facilitate the development of plugins for
	end user applications, as well as ease migration from a libSBML-based
	backend. AVAILABILITY: Source code, binaries and documentation for
	JSBML can be freely obtained under the terms of the LGPL 2.1 from
	the website http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML.},

  abstract = {Since the knowledge about processes in living cells is increasing,
	modelling and simulation techniques are used to get new insights
	into these complex processes. During the last few years, the SBML
	file format has gained in popularity and support as a means of exchanging
	model data between the different modelling and simulation tools.
	In addition to specifying the model as a set of equations, many modern
	modelling tools allow the user to create and to interact with the
	model in the form of a reaction graph. Unfortunately, the SBML file
	format does not provide for the storage of this graph data along
	with the mathematical description of the model.Therefore, we developed
	an extension to the SBML file format that makes it possible to store
	such layout information which describes position and size of objects
	in the graphical representation.The complete specification can be
	found on (http://projects.villa-bosch.de/bcb/sbml/ (SBML Layout Extension
	documentation, 2005). Additionally, a complete implementation exists

  journal = {IET Syst Biol},

  number = {5},
  month = {Sep},
  abstract = {Online databases store thousands of molecular interactions and pathways,
	and numerous modelling software tools provide users with an interface
	to create and simulate mathematical models of such interactions.
	However, the two most widespread used standards for storing pathway
	data (biological pathway exchange; BioPAX) and for exchanging mathematical
	models of pathways (systems biology markup language; SBML) are structurally
	and semantically different. Conversion between formats (making data
	present in one format available in another format) based on simple
	one-to-one mappings may lead to loss or distortion of data, is difficult
	to automate, and often impractical and/or erroneous. This seriously
	limits the integration of knowledge data and models. In this paper
	we introduce an approach for such integration based on a bridging
	format that we named systems biology pathway exchange (SBPAX) alluding
	to SBML and BioPAX. It facilitates conversion between data in different
	formats by a combination of one-to-one mappings to and from SBPAX
	and operations within the SBPAX data. The concept of SBPAX is to
	provide a flexible description expanding around essential pathway
	data - basically the common subset of all formats describing processes,
	the substances participating in these processes and their locations.
	SBPAX can act as a repository for molecular interaction data from
	a variety of sources in different formats, and the information about
	their relative relationships, thus providing a platform for converting
	between formats and documenting assumptions used during conversion,
	gluing (identifying related elements across different formats) and
	merging (creating a coherent set of data from multiple sources) data.},
