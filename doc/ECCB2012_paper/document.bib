	biological pathways at the molecular and cellular level and to facilitate

	data has spurred the development of databases and computational tools
	to aid interpretation; however, use of these data is hampered by
	the current fragmentation of pathway information across many databases
	with incompatible formats. BioPAX, which was created through a community
	process, solves this problem by making pathway data substantially
	easier to collect, index, interpret and share. BioPAX can represent
	metabolic and signaling pathways, molecular and genetic interactions
	and gene regulation networks. Using BioPAX, millions of interactions,
	organized into thousands of pathways, from many organisms are available
	from a growing number of databases. This large amount of pathway
	data in a computable form will support visualization, analysis and
	biological discovery.},

	for biochemical networks.}},
  journal = {BMC Syst Biol},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {2},
  pages = {39},
  abstract = {The development of complex biochemical models has been facilitated
	through the standardization of machine-readable representations like
	SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language). This effort is accompanied
	by the ongoing development of the human-readable diagrammatic representation
	SBGN (Systems Biology Graphical Notation). The graphical SBML editor
	CellDesigner allows direct translation of SBGN into SBML, and vice
	versa. For the assignment of kinetic rate laws, however, this process
	is not straightforward, as it often requires manual assembly and
	specific knowledge of kinetic equations.SBMLsqueezer facilitates
	exactly this modeling step via automated equation generation, overcoming
	the highly error-prone and cumbersome process of manually assigning
	kinetic equations. For each reaction the kinetic equation is derived
	from the stoichiometry, the participating species (e.g., proteins,
	mRNA or simple molecules) as well as the regulatory relations (activation,
	inhibition or other modulations) of the SBGN diagram. Such information
	allows distinctions between, for example, translation, phosphorylation
	or state transitions. The types of kinetics considered are numerous,
	for instance generalized mass-action, Hill, convenience and several
	Michaelis-Menten-based kinetics, each including activation and inhibition.
	These kinetics allow SBMLsqueezer to cover metabolic, gene regulatory,
	signal transduction and mixed networks. Whenever multiple kinetics
	are applicable to one reaction, parameter settings allow for user-defined
	specifications. After invoking SBMLsqueezer, the kinetic formulas
	are generated and assigned to the model, which can then be simulated
	in CellDesigner or with external ODE solvers. Furthermore, the equations
	can be exported to SBML, LaTeX or plain text format.SBMLsqueezer
	considers the annotation of all participating reactants, products
	and regulators when generating rate laws for reactions. Thus, for
	each reaction, only applicable kinetic formulas are considered. This
	modeling scheme creates kinetics in accordance with the diagrammatic
	representation. In contrast most previously published tools have
	relied on the stoichiometry and generic modulators of a reaction,
	thus ignoring and potentially conflicting with the information expressed
	through the process diagram. Additional material and the source code
	can be found at the project homepage (URL found in the Availability
	and requirements section).},

  abstract = {Summary: The specifications of the Systems Biology Markup Language
	(SBML) define standards for storing and exchanging computer models
	of biological processes in text files. In order to perform model
	simulations, graphical visualizations, and other software manipulations,
	an in-memory representation of SBML is required. We developed JSBML
	for this purpose. In contrast to prior implementations of SBML APIs,
	JSBML has been designed from the ground up for the Java\texttrademark{}
	programming language, and can therefore be used on all platforms
	supported by a Java Runtime Environment. This offers important benefits
	for Java users, including the ability to distribute software as Java
	Web Start applications. JSBML supports all SBML Levels and Versions
	through Level~3 Version~1, and we have strived to maintain the highest
	possible degree of compatibility with the popular library libSBML.
	JSBML also supports modules that can facilitate the development of
	plugins for end-user applications, as well as ease migration from
	a libSBML-based backend.
	
	Availability: Source code, binaries, and documentation for JSBML can
	be freely obtained under the terms of the LGPL 2.1 from the website

  abstract = {Online databases store thousands of molecular interactions and pathways,
	and numerous modelling software tools provide users with an interface
	to create and simulate mathematical models of such interactions.
	However, the two most widespread used standards for storing pathway
	data (biological pathway exchange; BioPAX) and for exchanging mathematical
	models of pathways (systems biology markup language; SBML) are structurally
	and semantically different. Conversion between formats (making data
	present in one format available in another format) based on simple
	one-to-one mappings may lead to loss or distortion of data, is difficult
	to automate, and often impractical and/or erroneous. This seriously
	limits the integration of knowledge data and models. In this paper
	we introduce an approach for such integration based on a bridging
	format that we named systems biology pathway exchange (SBPAX) alluding
	to SBML and BioPAX. It facilitates conversion between data in different
	formats by a combination of one-to-one mappings to and from SBPAX
	and operations within the SBPAX data. The concept of SBPAX is to
	provide a flexible description expanding around essential pathway
	data - basically the common subset of all formats describing processes,
	the substances participating in these processes and their locations.
	SBPAX can act as a repository for molecular interaction data from
	a variety of sources in different formats, and the information about
	their relative relationships, thus providing a platform for converting
	between formats and documenting assumptions used during conversion,
	gluing (identifying related elements across different formats) and
	merging (creating a coherent set of data from multiple sources) data.},

	Cancer Institute and Nature Publishing Group, the database serves

	or create interaction network maps centered on a single molecule
	or cellular process of interest. In addition, the batch query tool
	allows users to upload long list(s) of molecules, such as those derived
	from microarray experiments, and either overlay these molecules onto
	predefined pathways or visualize the complete molecular connectivity
	map. Users can also download molecule lists, citation lists and complete
	database content in extensible markup language (XML) and Biological
	Pathways Exchange (BioPAX) Level 2 format. The database is updated
