preparation scripts for Transfac2QualModel.java

factor.dat und site.dat are files from the Transfac database, which can be downloaded from the biobase website (http://www.biobase-international.com/ Login required).

usage of the perl-scripts: 

perl extract_factors.pl [factor.dat] [bindingFactor-file] [organism-file]
perl extract_sites.pl [site.dat] [bindingSites-file]
perl extract_genes.pl [gene.data] [genesAnnotation-file]


All transcriptionfactors will be extracted and can then be used to translate the data in a qualitative model.
The class Transfac2Qualmodel.java requires these four output files and furthermore the organisms which are allowed to include in the model, e.g.: "human,Mammalia".
