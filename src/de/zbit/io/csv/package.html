 This package consists mainly of the CSVReader method that can read any character separated files (no matter if they are
 tab, comma, space, etc. separated). These are tabular files, e.g., exported from excel.
 Furthermore, a CSVWriter and various other related IO classes are included.
 <b>Do NOT confuse CHARACTER-separated with COMMA-separated! The classes here must support more column separators than a comma.</b>
