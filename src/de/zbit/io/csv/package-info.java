 * This package consists mainly of the CSVReader method that can read any
 * character separated files (no matter if they are tab, comma, space, etc.
 * separated). These are tabular files, e.g., exported from excel. Furthermore,
 * a CSVWriter and various other related IO classes are included. <b>Do NOT
 * confuse CHARACTER-separated with COMMA-separated! The classes here must
 * support more column separators than a comma.</b>
