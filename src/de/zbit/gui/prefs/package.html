This package is intended to provide useful helper classes that support
the configuration of graphical user interfaces. It provides a generic dialog
and a generic panel for creating any kind of settings dialogs based on the
Java Properties hashtable.</p>
<p>The principle is to create a class derived from
SettingsPanel that exchanges its settings using the Properties class and
to put it into a package with the same name as this one, i.e., 
de.zbit.gui.cfg. The configuratin dialog will automatically find it using
java Reflection and will include it into the user interface.</p>
<p>All you have to do to make use of this is to declare how your specific
settings panel should look like and which elements should be on top of
it. Wrap all the user input in a Properties hashtable and that's it.</p>
