  A collection of classes for dealing with user-defined 
  options and configuration key, either from the command 
  line or from some system configuration. Thereby, three
  layers are considered: 
  <ol>
    <li>User options from the command line</li>
    <li>Options that are currently in memory but not yet 
        persistent</li>
    <li>Persistently saved user configuration</li>
  </ol> 
  The idea is to define a key-value pair for the option
  and an associated user-defined value and to re-use this
  pair in graphical user interfaces, on the command line
  and also at other positions within the program.
