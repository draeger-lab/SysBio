/**
 * The labeled clone marker includes an identifying label that can be used to
 * identify equivalent clones elsewhere in the map. This is particularly useful
 * for stateful EPNs, because these can have a large number of state variables
 * displayed and therefore may be dificult to visually identify as being
 * identical.
 * 
 * <p>
 * From the official SBGN-PD spec:<br/>
 * <i>A clone marker is identified by a label placed in an unbordered box
 * containing a string of characters. The characters can be distributed on
 * several lines to improve readability, although this is not mandatory. The
 * label box must be attached to the center of the container. The label may
 * spill outside of the container (the portion of the surface of the EPN that
 * has been modified visually). The font color of the label and the color of the
 * clone marker should contrast with one another. The label on a labeled clone
 * marker is mandatory.</i>
 * </p>
