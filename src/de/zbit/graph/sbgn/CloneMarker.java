/**
 * This interface must be implemented by all nodes, that can be cloned/ copied/
 * splitted to enhance the overall visualizability of the graph. E.g., when an
 * enzyme occurs in 3 reactions, it is mostly a much nicer graph if you create 3
 * nodes for the same enzyme.
 * 
 * <p>
 * According to SBGN-PD standards, the bottom 1/3 of those nodes must be colored
 * black:
 * <p>
 * <i>If an EPN is duplicated on a map, it is necessary to indicate this fact by
 * using the clone marker auxiliary unit. The purpose of this marker is to
 * provide the reader with a visual indication that this node has been cloned,
 * and that at least one other occurrence of the EPN can be found in the map (or
 * in a submap; see Section 2.7.1). The clone marker takes two forms, simple and
 * labeled, depending on whether the node being cloned can carry state variables
 * (i.e., whether it is a stateful EPN). Note that an EPN belongs to a single
 * compartment. If two glyphs labelled "X" are located in two different
 * compartments, such as ATP in cytosol and ATP in mitochondrial lumen, they
 * represent different EPNs, and therefore do not need to be marked as
 * cloned.</i>
