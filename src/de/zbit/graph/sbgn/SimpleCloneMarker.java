 * From the official SBGN-PD spec:<br/>
 * <i>The simple (unlabeled) clone marker is a portion of the surface of an EPN
 * that has been modifed visually through the use of a different shade, texture,
 * or color. Figure 2.5 illustrates this. The clone marker occupies the lower
 * part of the EPN. The filled area must be smaller than the unfilled one.</i>
